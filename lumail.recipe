#
# This recipe builds a binary release of the lumail console-based mail-client.
#
# Once built it will be copied to ~/
#



#
# Commands in the before-stage run on the host, in a temporary directory
#
before:
   git clone https://github.com/lumail/lumail/


#
# Commands in the during-phase are executed in a transient docker
# container.  If any step fails then the process will be aborted.
#
# The directory /work will be our workspace.  Because we cloned
# our source in the previous step to "lumail" that will be accessible
# as /work/lumail/
#
during:
        # Ensure we're in our source tree
        cd /work/lumail

        # Ensure we can install packages.
        apt-get update

        # Install the dependencies
        apt-get install --yes --force-yes libncursesw5-dev libncursesw5-dev  liblua5.2-dev pkg-config git-core libpcre3-dev  libgmime-2.6-dev libmagic-dev make build-essential

        # build the binary
        make


#
# Finally once we're complete copy the generated binary to ~/lumail-$image
#
after:
       cp lumail/lumail2 /home/skx/lumail-$IMAGE
