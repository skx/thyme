# This is the thyme-recipe
#
# We start out by cloning a remote Git repository, then we "build" that.
#
# Here we don't build - we just run "false" to terminate the build
#


#
# Here we populate the work-space with our code
#
before:
   git clone https://github.com/skx/templer


#
# The stuff here happens inside the temporary container.
#
# Because the command here fails we'll terminate at this step.
#
during:
        false

#
# Because the `during` steps failed we'll not see the output of this
# command - it won't be executed.
#
after:
       echo "I'm not here"
