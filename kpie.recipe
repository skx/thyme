#
# This recipe builds a Debian package of the `kpie` utility.
#
container = debian:stretch


#
# Commands in the before-stage run on the host, in a temporary directory
#
before:
   git clone https://github.com/skx/kpie/


#
# Commands in the during-phase are executed in a transient docker
# container.  If any step fails then the process will be aborted.
#
# The directory /work will be our workspace.  Because we cloned
# our source in the previous step to "kpie" that will be accessible
# as /work/kpie/
#
during:
        # Ensure we're in our source tree
        cd /work/kpie

        # Ensure we can install packages.
        apt-get update

        # Install the dependencies
        apt-get install --yes --force-yes debhelper libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libwnck-dev libx11-dev liblua5.1-0-dev pkg-config x11proto-core-dev build-essential devscripts

        # build the binary
        debuild -i -us -uc -b


#
# Finally once we're complete copy the generated package to /tmp/
#
# NOTE: `debuild` will generate the results in the parent-directory
# so we copy from `.` not `./kpie/`.
#
# Also remember that this step runs on the host.
#
after:
       cp kpie_* /tmp/
